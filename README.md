## General Guidelines

### Communicating
Start a conversation with us on [Discourse](https://discuss.cyberarkcommons.org/)! 

Our CyberArk Commons Discourse is where we share tips and tricks for using our products and tools,
updates on product changes and design conversations, discuss relevant blog posts and articles, and
answer your questions. Join us there to find out what we're thinking about - we'd be glad to have
you as part of our conversation! 

## Contributing
Many projects in our Github repositories encourage contribution, even this one! Our [contributor's

## Group-Specific Guidelines
CyberArk publishes many open source projects in https://github.com/cyberark - and there are a few
primary groups publishing this content who each may have slightly different guidelines for
contributing. In this section, you can learn more about the projects each group is working on and
read up on the contribution guidelines that are specific to each group.

### [CyberArk Conjur](Conjur/README.md)

#### What we do
At [Conjur Open Source](https://conjur.org/), weâ€™re creating the tools to help you build
applications safely and securely - without having to be a security expert. From our flagship Conjur
server (a secret store and RBAC engine), to custom authenticators that make the [secret
zero](https://www.conjur.org/blog/avoiding-secret-zero-securely-introducing-secrets-with-conjur/)
problem a thing of the past, to Secretless Broker, which aims to make sure your apps never have to
worry about secrets again. 

#### Projects we work on 

Visit our [Conjur OSS Suite Landing Page](https://cyberark.github.io/conjur/) to view a full list of
our projects and find helpful resources for learning more about our approach to security!

### [CyberArk Labs](Labs/README.md)

#### What we do
The security research groups at Cyberark Labs are busy with studying the attack surface of common
and emerging technologies. We fuzz, poke, bypass, maneuver, misuse, escalate, hijack, deny service,
degrade, escape and exploit the technologies, and from time to time we share here new tools you can
use to detect vulnerabilities and identify threats; based on our research of course.

You can have a look at what we are currently working on right here -
https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research-blog/.

#### Projects we work on 
We have a variety of projects for analyzing threats and detecting vulnerabilities. Click the
