# Conjur Community Code of Conduct

We are setting a new standard for how development, security, and operations
teams work together. We strive to give application developers protection from
breaches and confidence that they can code safely and deliver reliable software
fast without getting hacked.

Conjur is a piece of technology, but more importantly, we are a community.

We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly,
safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.

Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be tolerated.

## tl;dr

* Be respectful.
* We're here to help: <abuse@conjur.org>
* Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
* Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the
  Conjur community.

## Scope

We expect all members of the Conjur community, including paid and unpaid agents,
administrators, users, and customers of CyberArk, to abide by this Code of
Conduct at all times in all Conjur community venues, online and in person, and
in one-on-one communications pertaining to Conjur affairs.

This policy covers the usage of Conjur hosted services, as well as the Conjur
website, Conjur related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf
of CyberArk. (collectively, the "Service"). It also applies to behavior in the
context of the Conjur Open Source project communities, including but not limited
to public GitHub repositories, chat channels, social media, mailing lists, and
public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or
invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of the Service.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "offensive", "harrassing",
or "unacceptable behavior" will be decided at the sole discretion of the Conjur
abuse team.

## Maintaining a Friendly, Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity,
religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal
characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding
technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a
trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A
difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior
is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users of the Service is never tolerated, whether via public or
private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames or other identifiers that might
detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.


### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within
our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another
  person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory
  jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
  information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender identity,
  sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance,
  body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before
  touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes;
  inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

Please select the method of contact you think is most appropriate for
the form of violation:

* For urgent security issues, contact <security@conjur.org>.

* If you believe someone is harassing you or is demonstrating some other form of
  malicious or inappropriate behavior, contact <abuse@conjur.org>. If this is
  the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It
  is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

* If you have concerns about a potential copyright violation, contact
  <legal@cyberark.com>.


## Consequences

All content published to the Service, including user account credentials, is
hosted at the sole discretion of the Conjur administrators.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, employees,
customers, or others with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the Conjur
administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a
temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and
without refund in the case of a paid event or service.)

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should notify CyberArk. We will do our best to ensure that your
grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being
most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

## Contact Info

Please contact <abuse@conjur.org> if you need to report a problem or address a
grievance related to an abuse report.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that
might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are
happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community. Our
[community chat][chat] is open.
